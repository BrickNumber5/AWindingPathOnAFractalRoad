This is example text including *bold*, /italics/, and other fancifully styled text. Styles can even be */nested/*

# ---

This is the second page.

# ---

Here on this page there is an unreadable blank where the user fills in: __@blank:"left","right"__. Its options are "left" and "right".

# -> @skip

Since this section is behind a jump that jumps past it, it is unreachable.

# @skip

The formatting options available also include _underlined_ text and ~crossed out~ text.

# ---

This page has two (2) "paragraphs" on it.

Here's the second one.

The previous page was blank.

This page has a whole, whole, whole bunch of text that doesn't actually finish on this page and therefore the text on the next page doesn't start with an indent because it is continuing on from this one. This is accomplished by replacing the triple dash page break

# ...

with a triple dot page break.

# ---

# ?-> @blank
  "left" -> @left
  "right" -> @right

# @left

You'll see this *bold* text if you chose left.

# -> @merge

# @right

You'll see this /italic/ text if you chose right.

# -> @merge

# @merge

(You'll see this text regardless)

# ---

This is a test that escape characters work: \\ \* \* \* \\

Text that looks like the above is accomplished by writing "\\\\ \\\* \\\* \\\* \\\\" in the markup.

This is the final page.

# -> @END
