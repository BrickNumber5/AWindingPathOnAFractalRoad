This is example text including *bold*, /italics/, and other fancifully styled text.

# ---

This is the second page.

# ---

Here on this page there is an unreadable blank where the user fills in: __@blank:"left","right"__. Its options are "left" and "right".

# -> @skip

Since this section is behind a jump that jumps past it, it is unreachable.

# @skip

The formatting options available also include _underlined_ text and ~crossed out~ text.

# ---

This page has two (2) "paragraphs" on it.

Here's the second one.

# ---

# ---

The previous page was blank.

# ---

# ?-> @blank
  "left" -> @left
  "right" -> @right

# @left

You'll see this *bold* text if you chose left.

# -> @merge

# @right

You'll see this /italic/ text if you chose right.

# -> @merge

# @merge

(You'll see this text regardless)

This is the final page.

# -> @END
